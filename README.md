This project uses the youtube_transcription_api to retrieve transcriptions or use speech to text conversion transformer models to obtain transcription of YouTube videos. By obtaining the text content, we can then apply natural language processing (NLP) techniques to generate summaries. At the core of our summarization process is DistilBERT, a smaller, faster, and more efficient version of the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from (Transformers) model. DistilBERT maintains 97% of BERT's performance while being 60% faster and smaller, making it an ideal choice for real-time applications. The tool we developed allows users to input a YouTube video URL and receive a concise, AIgenerated summary of the video's content. The summary provides an overview of the key points discussed in the video, enabling users to quickly grasp the main ideas without watching the entire video. By integrating state-of-the-art AI models and APIs, this project showcases the potential of combining NLP and video content to enhance information accessibility and user convenience.
